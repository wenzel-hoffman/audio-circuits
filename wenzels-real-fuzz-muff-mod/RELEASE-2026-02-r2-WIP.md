## Difference (changelog) from previous release (revision 1)

- Add 10uF emitter bypass capacitors for gain stages to get more gain so that
  transistors clipping is reached more easily.

- Change VOLTS knobs from linear to logarithmic so that the most effective area
  has more physical range for precise adjustment.

- Add optional asymmetric LED clipping diodes with an individual switch for each
  diode allowing for a variety of clipping texture. Note that LEDs have a very
  high forward voltage compared to original 1n4148.
